### What I learned

#### A LOT :D

- Reactive forms

- Receiving Input, emitting Output events
- FormControl validation
- Custom FormControl validator

### Continued development

- Make the card number input, to automatically place spaces after 4 digits, so the user does not have to type the spaces.
